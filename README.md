# Example docs setup

An example docs site using Yarn Workspaces and powered by Next.js and Markdoc that renders inline code samples using a custom Markdoc component that references real, testable code from a separate workspace.

See the blog post [TODO][blog-post] for more context.

## Quick start

To run the example docs site, first clone the repository and then install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nextmv-io/docs-code-example.git
cd docs-code-example
yarn install
```

Run the site with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the example Docs site with code snippets.

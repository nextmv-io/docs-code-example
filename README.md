# Example docs setup

An example docs site using Yarn Workspaces and powered by Next.js and Markdoc that renders inline code samples using a custom Markdoc component that references real, testable code from a separate workspace.

See the blog post [TODO][blog-post] for more context.

## Quick start

To run the example docs site, first clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone [TODO]
cd [TODO]
yarn install
```

Run the site with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

And then visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
